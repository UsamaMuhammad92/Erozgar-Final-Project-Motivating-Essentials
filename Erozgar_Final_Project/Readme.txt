I have made a website that displays Motivational Quotes and Motivational Book names.

I have used PHP CRUD, but edit is not working.

I have done following with proper functioning.

1) Used Bootstrap for UI of my website.
2) Used Google Fonts.
3) Deleting Record is working fine.
4) Adding Record is working fine.
5) Made logo using Photoshop

Following are missing.

1) Contact Page
2) About Page
3) There shoud be a login page after clicking 'Admin Area', its missing.
4) Quotes and Books pages are also displying 'Action', because I have directed them to admin page. There should be a seperate page for both. Its missing.
